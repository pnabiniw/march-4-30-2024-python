# Loops are used to perform repetitive task in Python
# Loops are also called iterations
# There are two types of loops in Python

# 1. for loop
# 2. while loop
# 3. do...while (This is not possible in python)


# For loops in python
# for loop is used with iterables (sequence data) in python
# Unlike in C/C#/Java condition is not checked in python for loop

# for(i=0;i<=10;i++){
#     printf(i)
# }

# range is a python built-in function to generate n numbers
